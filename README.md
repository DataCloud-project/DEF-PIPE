# DEF-PIPE
DEF-PIPE provides a visual design for implementing Big Data pipelines based on a DSL, including storing and loading the pipeline definitions and displaying them in a user interface where domain experts declare the pipeline structure. Furthermore, it enables data scientists to define the content by configuring each step and injecting code or customising generic predefined step templates. 
DEF-PIPE provides the following functionality: 

- DSL described by a context-free grammar captures the distributed data pipeline syntax and semantics and provides data serialisation and de-serialisation format. 

- Graphical user interface enables domain scientists to graphically describe, configure, deploy, and simulate data pipelines using a corresponding DSL compiler capturing its definitions and documentation. 

- Predefined pipeline and step templates provide a library of existing implementations for injection and reuse into the current pipeline.
